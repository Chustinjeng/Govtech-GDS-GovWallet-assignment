# Govtech-GDS-GovWallet-assignment

My name is Justin Cheng. My email is justcheng2000@gmail.com. This is the online assessment for the internship role "Tech - Software Engineer: GovSupply & GovWallet".

## Assumptions and design considerations

In this online assessment, although I considered using MongoDB to store the redemption data, I eventually chose not to because I was afraid of the cloud service not functioning as expected due to connection issues. I eventually settled on a local CSV file for storage of redemption data.

Although not explicitly mentioned in the question, I assume that each team can only collect gifts once, which means that any team that tries to collect gifts for the second time would be deemed inelligible for redemption.
